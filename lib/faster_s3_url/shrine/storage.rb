    #
    #  * we do not support the :signer option in initialier (why would you want to use that with this? Let me know)
    #
    #  * We support a `host` option on initializer, but do NOT support the `host` option on #url (I don't underestand
    #  why it's per-call in the first place, do you need it to be?)
    #
    #  * You DO need to supply access_key_id and secret_access_key in initializer, they can not be automatically
    #  looked up from AWS environmental chain. See README.
